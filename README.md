## The Future of Web3 Wallets — Powered by Natural Language & Account Abstraction

**CORE AI** is revolutionizing how users interact with blockchain. With a **built-in AI assistant**, **passkey-based authentication**, and full support for **ERC-4337 account abstraction**, it enables seamless, intuitive, and secure blockchain experiences — all in one click.

No mnemonic phrases. No gas fees to worry about. Just simple, fast, and secure access to decentralized finance, NFTs, and dApps — directly from your browser or Telegram.

## 🧩 Why WALLET AI?

> "Usability meets decentralization"

We believe blockchain should be accessible to everyone — not just developers. That’s why we’re building WALLET AI: to make interacting with Web3 as easy as typing a message.

By removing technical barriers and offering powerful new capabilities through AI and account abstraction, we are paving the way for true mass adoption.

The reason for WALLET AI is simple: blockchain is a technology that needs to be in **everyone’s hands, without borders**. Today, most users are still technically inclined people — but that needs to change. Blockchain should be as universal and easy as using any everyday app, bringing decentralized access to everyone.

## ✨ Your On-Chain Identity: The Genesis Token

Every CORE AI wallet is born with a **Genesis Soulbound Token (SBT)** — a unique, non-transferable NFT that serves as your permanent on-chain identity. This isn't just a digital collectible; it's your wallet's "birth certificate," with unique traits generated by **dcipher's verifiable randomness**.

### How It Works

1. **One-Click Creation**: When you create a new wallet, our `SimpleAccountFactory` is called.
2. **Randomness Request**: The factory instantly triggers the `GenesisSBT` contract to request a verifiable random number from the dcipher network.
3. **Gasless Minting**: Thanks to our Paymaster, this entire process, including the minting of your SBT, is **completely gas-free** for you.
4. **Unique Traits**: Once the random number is securely delivered on-chain, your Genesis SBT is minted with a unique set of generative traits, including a visual "Cosmic Signature" and a special "Origin Title."

Currently, the minted Soulbound NFT is only attached to the wallet address.  
In the future, we plan to integrate **KYC using zkTLS proofs**, enabling on-chain verification that can be securely and privately added to the Soulbound NFT.  
This way, your on-chain identity evolves into a **trust-enhanced passport** for Web3, while preserving privacy and decentralization.

> Soulbound NFTs in WALLET AI can evolve to include:
>
> - ✅ **KYC with zkTLS proofs** for privacy-preserving identity verification
> - ✅ **Reputation systems** (on-chain score/history tied to your wallet)
> - ✅ **Achievements & credentials** (certifications, DAO memberships, hackathon badges)
> - ✅ **Dynamic traits** that update based on your on-chain activity (e.g., staking level, governance participation, DeFi milestones)
> - ✅ **Access control** for gated dApps, events, and communities using your Soulbound identity
>
> This turns the Soulbound NFT into more than just a wallet certificate — it becomes your evolving, **trust-enhanced digital passport** for Web3.
