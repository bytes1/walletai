## The Future of Web3 Wallets â€” Powered by Natural Language & Account Abstraction

**WALLET AI** is revolutionizing how users interact with blockchain. With a **built-in AI assistant**, **passkey-based authentication**, and full support for **ERC-4337 account abstraction**, it enables seamless, intuitive, and secure blockchain experiences â€” all in one click.

No mnemonic phrases. No gas fees to worry about. Just simple, fast, and secure access to decentralized finance, NFTs, and dApps â€” directly from your browser or Telegram.

## ðŸ§© Why WALLET AI?

> "Usability meets decentralization"

We believe blockchain should be accessible to everyone â€” not just developers. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building WALLET AI: to make interacting with Web3 as easy as typing a message.

By removing technical barriers and offering powerful new capabilities through AI and account abstraction, we are paving the way for true mass adoption.

The reason for WALLET AI is simple: blockchain is a technology that needs to be in **everyoneâ€™s hands, without borders**. Today, most users are still technically inclined people â€” but that needs to change. Blockchain should be as universal and easy as using any everyday app, bringing decentralized access to everyone.

## âœ¨ Your On-Chain Identity: The Genesis Token

Every AI wallet is born with a **Genesis Soulbound Token (SBT)** â€” a unique, non-transferable NFT that serves as your permanent on-chain identity. This isn't just a digital collectible; it's your wallet's "birth certificate," with unique traits generated by **dcipher's verifiable randomness**.

### How It Works

1. **One-Click Creation**: When you create a new wallet, our `SimpleAccountFactory` is called.
2. **Randomness Request**: The factory instantly triggers the `GenesisSBT` contract to request a verifiable random number from the dcipher network.
3. **Gasless Minting**: Thanks to our Paymaster, this entire process, including the minting of your SBT, is **completely gas-free** for you.
4. **Unique Traits**: Once the random number is securely delivered on-chain, your Genesis SBT is minted with a unique set of generative traits, including a visual "Cosmic Signature" and a special "Origin Title."

Currently, the minted Soulbound NFT is only attached to the wallet address.  
In the future, we plan to integrate **KYC using zkTLS proofs**, enabling on-chain verification that can be securely and privately added to the Soulbound NFT.  
This way, your on-chain identity evolves into a **trust-enhanced passport** for Web3, while preserving privacy and decentralization.

## ðŸŽ¨ Genesis SBT NFT Details

<img src="images/nft.png" height="500"/>

Every WALLET AI identity begins with a **Genesis SBT** â€” your permanent proof of origin on-chain.

| Attribute     | Value            |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Edition**   | Genesis          |
| **Status**    | Active           |
| **Rarity**    | Mythic           |
| **Minted On** | 2025-08-18       |
| **Soulbound** | Non-transferable |
| **KYC**       | Not Verified     |

The Genesis SBT is a **soulbound token**, meaning it **cannot be transferred** or sold. Instead, it anchors your walletâ€™s existence and represents your **unique membership** in the Wallet AI ecosystem.

Future updates will allow the NFT to **evolve dynamically**, integrating:

- âœ… KYC verification (via zkTLS proofs)
- âœ… Reputation-based traits & scores
- âœ… Credentials (DAO memberships, hackathon badges, certifications)
- âœ… Visual trait upgrades tied to on-chain activity

This makes your Genesis SBT not just an ID but a **living passport for Web3**.
